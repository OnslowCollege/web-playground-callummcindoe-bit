	     <h1>Ahead of its time music</h1>
		 <h3>Music from a future passed...</h3>
		 <p>Music that sounds like would've come out a whole lot later.</p>
		 <p>I am very interested in the history of music, and that plays naturally into this website. I find it so interesting how a group or person can just... transcend into the future and make something new, <strong> Way before <strong> anything like it had come about.</p>
