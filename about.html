	     <h1>Ahead of its time music</h1>
		 <h3>Music from a future passed...</h3>
		 <p>Music that sounds like would've come out a whole lot later.</p>
		 <p>I am very interested in the history of music, and that plays naturally into this website. I find it so interesting how a group or person can just... transcend into the future and make something new, <strong> Way before <strong> anything like it had come about.</p>

		 <p> First up we have the band Blast from Mons in Belgium, which played in a proto-hardcore punk/metal stylings, way before anything else like it was even throught of. They released 2 songs, "Damned Flame" and "Hope", recorded in as many hours. The impact on any other bands is most likely little to none; there was only around 100 to 500 copies made, along with only having 2 songs and only apperently doing one performance. Then they had to break up as the guitarist Tony Colonius had to leave to go do military service. They only really got rediscovered in the 2000s, finally being repressed by Canadian label Death Vault in 2015.
